def disco_score(X: np.ndarray, labels: np.ndarray, min_points: int = 5) -> float:
    """Compute the mean DISCO score of all samples.

    The DISCO score is a measure of how well samples are clustered
    with samples that are similar to themselves. Clustering models with a high
    DISCO score are said to be dense, where samples in the same
    cluster are similar to each other, and well separated, where samples in
    different clusters are not very similar to each other.
    Additionally, the DISCO score measures noise in relation to the given
    clustering. If noise lays within a sparse region and is far away from
    cluster regions it scores a high value, otherwise it will get a low value.

    The DISCO score is calculated using the mean intra-cluster on the
    dc-distance (``a``) and the mean nearest-cluster on the dc-distance (``b``)
    for each non noise sample.  The DISCO score for a non noise sample is
    ``(b - a) / max(a, b)``.
    To clarify, ``b`` is the dc-distance between a non noise sample and the nearest
    cluster that the sample is not a part of.
    ``-1`` in labels are considered as noise and their DISCO score is calculated
    by the minimum of the two different measures ``p_sparse`` and ``p_far``.
    ``p_sparse`` measures how well the noise sample is within a sparse region.
    ``p_far`` measure how well the noise is remote to non noise samples.
    Note that DISCO score is defined for all possible number of labels
    ``1 <= n_labels <= n_samples``.
    Except for ``-1`` every other value is considered as cluster label.

    This function returns the mean DISCO score over all samples.
    To obtain the values for each sample, use :func:`disco_samples`.

    The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1. Values near 0 indicate
    overlapping clusters. Negative values generally indicate that a sample has
    been assigned to the wrong cluster, as a different cluster is more similar.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of (n_samples_a, n_features)
        A feature array.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Predicted labels for each sample.

    min_points : int
        ``min_points`` value to use for the dc-distance.

    -------
    disco_score : float
        Mean DISCO score for all samples.

    ``p_sparse`` calculates how well the noise sample lays within a sparse region.

    To clarify, ``p_sparse`` and ``p_far`` are calculated depending on the existing

    In this function, ``-1`` is handled as noise. The return value consists of a

    The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1 for both ``p_sparse`` and ``p_far``.
    For ``p_sparse``, values near 0 indicate that the noise sample is within an area which
    is as sparse as the sparsest existing cluster. Note that this value is calculated
    depending on the sparsest cluster.  Negative values indicate that the noise sample has

    For ``p_far``, values near 0 indicate that the noise sample lays at the border of
    an existing cluster. Negative values generally indicate that a noise sample lays within
    an existing cluster.
